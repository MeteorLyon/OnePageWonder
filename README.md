allow me to introduce you to the newest (and fastest) tool in your #MeteorJS profit machine, #OnePageWonder by @iDoMeteor
it's supposed to be buggy, it's beta.1! it's still super useable & fairly secure tho! :D #OnePageWonder
i am in the process of a major code re-factor (v1.0.0-beta.2) but this is a good state for historical purposes - if anyone in the future should choose to study such things
meteor --port 31308 --settings opw.json
meteor --settings opw.json deploy xxx.meteor.com | xxx.com | xxx.yyy.com
please install using the curl installer for each new project,
rather than say..copying your existing dirs.  this will
help me feel like someone is using it when i look
at the stats 
'set it & forget it...till they want to pay for more :D'jkkkjjkkk
this is beta *1*, i will do my best to make upgrades painless..but this is mostly made for 'set it and forget it' style production, to fit with the rest of our disposable economy :)  when you or your client outgrow your stable OPW install, commit to a big upgrade and customizations or move to MeteorPress!  Of course, I do intend to grow this into a great thing with auto-upgrades and plugins and all the other goodies...but... BETA 1!
...extremely interested in discussions/chats about methodology, and introducing OPW to students!
